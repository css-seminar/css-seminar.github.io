## My expectations

<!-- 
Answer the following:
What type of talk to you expect? (categorize your expectations on at least two dimensions)
I expect this talk to highlight ways to ethnically design AI models while keeping many of the major issues in mind. She will emphasize the importance of the software developer's deep understanding of these issues. She will also go over the criteria of what determines a good and poor AI design.

What about this talk do you think will be most useful to you?
The information regarding what determines a good and a poor AI design will be the most useful to me. I always believe that the discussion of the balance between powerful AI systems and systems that protect the rights of the public is important. Everyone has a different view and perspective on it, so it is interesting to compare and contrast them to each other.

Do you expect to understand only the big picture or the details of this talk?
I do expect to understand a lot of the details of this talk because our department is constantly having conversations about the ethnics of AI. I've heard a lot of different perspectives about the issues surrounding AI. I believe that being exposed to these variety of perspectives will help me better understand the details in this talk.
