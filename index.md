The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting the health and safety of our community. Students who are experiencing symptoms of viral illness should NOT go to class/work. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/guidance/index.html) recommends that all people who are experiencing viral illness should stay home and away from others until symptoms improve and they are fever free (without medications) for 24 hours. They should take added precautions for the next 5 days. 

### **Excused Absences** 

Absences due to serious illness or traumatic loss, religious observances, military service, or participation in a university-sanctioned event are considered excused absences. Students are responsible for work missed during an excused absence but will not be penalized by grading or assignment/exam make-up policies. Students should notify faculty in advance of absences due to religious observance or university-sanctioned events, and as soon as possible for other absences. [See University Manual sections 8.51.11-8.51.16](https://web.uri.edu/manual/chapter-8/chapter-8-4/) for details.

The Title IX Coordinator also provides support to pregnant and parenting students, in collaboration with the Dean of Students, and to pregnant and parenting employees, in collaboration with the Office of Human Resources.

Every qualified student with a disability has the right to equal access to educational programs, services, activities, and facilities.

Faculty are required by law to provide these accommodations and are encouraged to review the information on the [DAI website](https://web.uri.edu/disability/for-faculty-and-staff/).

Testing accommodations are administered by the Academic Testing Center and must be coordinated by the faculty.

### **Land Acknowledgement** {#land-acknowledgement}

The University of Rhode Island land acknowledgment is a statement written by members of the University community in close partnership with members of the Narragansett Tribe. The statement recognizes and pays tribute to the people who lived on and stewarded the land on which the University now resides. The statement seeks to show gratitude and respect to Indigenous people and cultures and build community with the Narragansett Nation and other Native American tribes.

**University of Rhode Island Land Acknowledgment**

*The University of Rhode Island occupies the traditional stomping ground of the Narragansett Nation and the Niantic People. We honor and respect the enduring and continuing relationship between the Indigenous people and this land by teaching and learning more about their history and present-day communities, and by becoming stewards of the land we, too, inhabit.*
